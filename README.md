This code is an example of using a convolutional neural network (CNN) to colorize a grayscale image. 
The CNN is pre-trained on a dataset of colorized images, and it learns to predict the color of each pixel 
in the grayscale image. The code first loads the CNN model and the pre-trained weights. It then loads 
the grayscale image and converts it to the L*a*b color space. The L*a*b color space is a three-channel 
color space that is often used for colorization tasks. The L channel represents the lightness of the 
image, and the a and b channels represent the color. The code then resizes the L*a*b image to 224x224 
pixels, which is the input size of the CNN model. The L channel of the image is then subtracted by 50, 
which is a common preprocessing step for colorization tasks. The CNN model is then used to predict 
the a and b channels of the image. The a and b channels are then resized to the original size of the 
image. The L channel of the image is then concatenated with the a and b channels to create a colorized 
image. The colorized image is then converted back to the RGB color space and clipped to the range
 [0, 1]. The clipped image is then multiplied by 255 and converted to the uint8 data type. The original 
grayscale image and the colorized image are then displayed.

This is a  script for colorizing a grayscale image using the OpenCV library. 
It uses a pre-trained deep neural network model for colorization. Here's a breakdown of what the code 
does:

1. Imports the necessary libraries: `numpy` and `cv2` (OpenCV).
2. Prints a message indicating that the models are being loaded.
3. Loads the colorization model from the provided prototxt and caffemodel files using `cv2.dnn.readNetFromCaffe`.
4. Loads the pre-defined color points from the `pts_in_hull.npy` file and prepares them for input to the network.
5. Sets the colorization model's layer blobs with the loaded color points and a constant value for the convolutional layer.
6. Reads an input image using `cv2.imread`.
7. Normalizes the image's pixel values to the range [0, 1] by dividing by 255.
8. Converts the image from the BGR color space to the LAB color space using `cv2.cvtColor`.
9. Resizes the LAB image to a target size of (224, 224).
10. Extracts the L channel (lightness) from the LAB image.
11. Subtracts 50 from the L channel to normalize its values.
12. Sets the input blob of the colorization model to the L channel.
13. Performs forward pass through the network to obtain the colorized ab channels.
14. Resizes the predicted ab channels back to the size of the original image.
15. Retrieves the L channel from the LAB image.
16. Concatenates the L and colorized ab channels to obtain the final colorized LAB image.
17. Converts the colorized LAB image from the LAB color space back to the BGR color space.
18. Clips the pixel values to the range [0, 1] and scales them to the range [0, 255].
19. Displays the original and colorized images using `cv2.imshow`.
20. Waits for a key press to exit the program using `cv2.waitKey`.

Lab stands for Lightness, channel a and channel b. Basically, it's a global color model where you can 
specify any given color by giving numeric values across these three different channels to edit image 
colors.

Input Grayscale Image: A black and white or grayscale image is provided as input to the colorization algorithm.

Feature Extraction: The colorization model extracts meaningful features from the grayscale image using convolutional layers. These features are 
then passed through the network to predict the color information.

Color Prediction: The colorization algorithm predicts the color values for each pixel in the grayscale image based on the extracted features and 
learned associations between grayscale and color data.

Output Colorized Image: The colorized image is produced as the final output, representing an estimate of what the original image may have looked 
like in color.
